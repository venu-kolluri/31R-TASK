        <li><h4>EXPRESS JS</h4></li>
        <p>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a list of features for building web and mobile applications easily. It simplifies the development of server-side applications by offering an easy-to-use API for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities.</p>
        <h2><U>DATABASE</U></h2>
        <li><h4>SQL</h4></li>
        <p>This SQL tutorial helps you get started with SQL quickly and effectively through many practical examples.If you are a software developer, database administrator, data analyst, or data scientist who wants to use SQL to analyze data, this tutorial is a good start.</p>
        <li><h4>MYSQL</h4></li>
        <p>MySQL is the most popular and a free Open Source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). An RDBMS system stores the data in the form of tables that might be related to each other. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to store, manage and retrieve data, and control the accessibility to the data. It is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing web-based software applications.</p>
        <li><h4>MONGODB</h4></li>
        <P>The MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. MongoDB is written in C++. This tutorial will give you great understanding on MongoDB concepts needed to create and deploy a highly scalable and performance-oriented database.</P></ul>
